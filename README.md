# GiftCards.GiftCards
A small mod that adds giftcards to the game  
Still in active development. (Kinda like every mod, not?)

Idea by: 
  * **Loneztar**  
   Go check her out! She's cool. www.twitch.tv/loneztar  
   Streams all kind of stuff: Minecraft (Various servers/playtroughs), Borderlands (1/2)  
   You can find her any weekday, but wednesday from 18:30 till 20:00 UK time.  
  
  
  
  
    
Help by: 
  * **AEnterprise**:  
   Awesome modder! Has various projects he's working on.  
   Most known for Buildcraft Additions, Buildcraft and since recently working on Kinetic Revolution, the successor to Builcraft Additions.  
  * **Heldplayer & Amadornes**:   
   Two very wise people! Ama is a seasoned modder and held is a great person!
        
IRC: Does this mod REALLY need a seperate IRC Channel? **_sigh_**

How to install:
  * Download the source files into a folder from which you would like to work.  
  + Open a command prompt in that folder (Windows tip: Shift-Right click on an empty space in the folder, and select "Open command prompt from here")  
  * Run 'gradlew setupDecompWorkspace'  
  + Run either 'gradlew idea' (for those who prefer IntelliJ) or 'gradlew eclipse' (for those who prefer Eclipse)  
  * (IntelliJ users open the project from the .ipr file)  
    
Wanna make changes:

    Most looking for translations and some textures.
